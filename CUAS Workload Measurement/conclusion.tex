\section{Summary and Future Work}
This paper proposes a model-checking approach to analyzing human workload in an UAS.  Humans and other autonomous actors were modeled as modified Mealy machines, yielding a directed graph representing team communication.  Workload categories are distilled from the literature, and the models of the actors and team are augmented so that specific workload metrics can be obtained using model-checking.  Preliminary analysis demonstrates a weak level of validity, namely, that the temporal workload profile is consistent with expected behavior for a set of well-understood situations.  For these scenarios, inter-actor communication is a primary cause of spikes in workload. 

For future work, we plan to add an actor to represent a human performing the role of integrating the UAS into the National Air Space operations. A sensitivity study, followed by an experiment with real human users is needed to understand and justify the workload measures. Once we have verified that our system analyzes workload correctly, it will be useful to design a GUI optimized to managing workload and to formulate a generalized model that will have application to other human-machine systems.
