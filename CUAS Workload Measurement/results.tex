`\section{Results}
In the interest of consolidating operators it is critical to find an accurate measurement that detects situations that exceed the capacity of a given human. One way to detect this is by building a map of each actor's workload as a function of time. JPF explores all possible paths the model can take and returns the ones that violate the model's criteria. By augmenting our model with the metrics described above we can identify all possible areas of high workload. 

We propose three levels of increasing validity for evaluating the approach in the paper.  The first level, the one used in this paper, is to check for {\em consistency}.  We say that the approach is {\em consistent} if the workload peaks, valleys, and trends match what we know about a small set of given situations; in other words, the approach is consistent if it matches our expectations on tasks that we know a lot about.  

The second level, which is an area for future work, is to check for {\em sensitivity}.  We say that  the approach is sufficiently {\em sensitive} if we can use JPF to create new scenarios that have very high or very low workloads, and we can then generate a satisfactory explanation for the levels of workload by evaluating the new scenarios.  The third level, which is also an area of future work, is to {\em substantiate} workload levels using experiments with human participants by comparing the perceived workload of humans with those predicted by the model.

In this paper, we restrict attention to finding areas of high and low workload, and then checking these areas for consistency.  We evaluated consistency using two scenarios.  The first is when the Video Operator was able to identify the target during a flight without any complications occurring (see Figure~\ref{fig:WorkloadSim1}). For the first 40 time steps everything behaves as expected with low to moderate workload. An initial workload bump occurs as actors exchange information necessary to start a search.   At time step forty we see a dramatic deviation from the norm. This is a result of constant information passing between the GUIs and the operators. Since there is a constant passing of data between the machinery and the operators, it is only logical that the workload would increase substantially. However the results indicate that a weighting should be instigated to balance the three workload measures rather than allowing the single category to dominate the system. In our sensitivity study we will verify whether this is a fault in our metrics or if this one scenario lends itself to the distortion.  {\sc what happens to cause this spike, and why does it abate?}

The second simulation includes a situation where, after a short period of flight, the battery rapidly fails. In this particular situation the operator was unable to respond quickly enough to land the UAV before it crashed (see Figure~\ref{fig:WorkloadSim2}). There is an immediate spike in the temporal workload but, surprisingly,the workload then decreases back to normal levels in just five time steps. {\sc Why?} The second spike indicates an unexpected fluctuation in options among one of the actors, which will have to be investigated further to verify if this is an accurate response or if a flaw in the model had slipped past the verification stage of development. Finally, as would be expected, when the UAV crashed there was a small spike in the workload before everything came to a halt.

These two simulations demonstrate that workload rises and falls as expected and provide evidence that the approach is consistent with expectations.  However, there is also one event that was surprising and that needs further study.
