\section{Directed Role Graph (DiRG)}

In previous work we represented each member of the WiSAR system as a unique directed role graph(DiRG). See figure 1. As is common
when modeling human-automation interaction we modeled the DiRGs using Mealy state machines which we refer to as Actors~\cite{bolton2013litreview}. However the model did not lend itself well to workload analysis. Converting the actors to Moore machines allowed for greater precision in model validation and workload analysis.
