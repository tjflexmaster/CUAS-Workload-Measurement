% *** Authors should verify (and, if needed, correct) their LaTeX system  ***
% *** with the testflow diagnostic prior to trusting their LaTeX platform ***

% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print. Authors are encouraged to use U.S. letter paper when
% submitting to IEEE. Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify
% correct handling of both paper sizes by the author's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
% This paper can be formatted using the peerreviewca
% (instead of conference) mode.
% If the IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it:
% \documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% To use A4 paper, add a4paper option as in
% \documentclass[conference,a4paper]{IEEEtran}


% setup page to suit conference specification using fancyhdr

% some very useful LaTeX packages include:

\usepackage{graphicx}  % Written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz
                        % Required if you want graphics, photos, etc.
                        % graphicx.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
                        % systems. The latest version and documentation can
                        % be obtained at:
                        % http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
                        % Another good source of documentation is "Using
                        % Imported Graphics in LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl
                        % which can be found as esplatex.ps and epslatex.pdf
                        % at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
                        % NOTE: for dual use with latex and pdflatex, instead load graphicx like:
                        %\ifx\pdfoutput\undefined
                        %\usepackage{graphicx}
                        %\else
                        %\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
                        %\fi
                        %
                        % However, be warned that pdflatex will require graphics to be in PDF
                        % (not EPS) format and will preclude the use of PostScript based LaTeX
                        % packages such as psfrag.sty and pstricks.sty. IEEE conferences typically
                        % allow PDF graphics (and hence pdfLaTeX). However, IEEE journals do not
                        % (yet) allow image formats other than EPS or TIFF. Therefore, authors of
                        % journal papers should use traditional LaTeX with EPS graphics.
                        %
                        % The path(s) to the graphics files can also be declared: e.g.,
                        % \graphicspath{{../eps/}{../ps/}}
                        % if the graphics files are not located in the same directory as the
                        % .tex file. This can be done in each branch of the conditional above
                        % (after graphicx is loaded) to handle the EPS and PDF cases separately.
                        % In this way, full path information will not have to be specified in
                        % each \includegraphics command.
                        %
                        % Note that, when switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the new
                        % compiler will have to be run twice to clear some warnings.

\usepackage{amsmath}   % From the American Mathematical Society
                        % A popular package that provides many helpful commands
                        % for dealing with mathematics. Note that the AMSmath
                        % package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000 thus
                        % preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline
                        % equations. Use:
                        %\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
                        % after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks
                        % as IEEEtran.cls normally does. amsmath.sty is already
                        % installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version
                        % and documentation can be obtained at:
                        % http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/

% Pdflatex produces superior hyperref results and is the recommended
% compiler for such use.

%can provide new insight into human machine interactions through role.   UAS-enabled Wilderness Search and Rescue (WiSAR) %as a collection of roles running in parallel.   as well as an encoding of this model in Java. This yields a precise formalization of %the individual WiSAR roles and allows behavior of the roles to be model-checked by
%Java Pathfinder to establish bounds and trends in the models. Results from the modeling activity and model-checking in Java %Pathfinder indicate (a)~that it is necessary to clearly identify an appropriate level of modeling abstraction and (b)~that building %and evaluating the model provide insight into the best practices for real and UAS-enabled WiSAR teams.
